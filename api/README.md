# api/

I needed an online RESTful API which the client
can use when trying to e.g. pre-identify items.

I decided none of the currently-existing
solutions worked, wynndata is not a standard
JSON (or other useful) format (it only serves
webpages), and the official Wynncraft API has
basically no support for filtering and sorting.

Therefore I will create an online JSON API
service that supports complex filtering and
sorting.
